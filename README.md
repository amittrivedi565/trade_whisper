The error you're seeing:

```
Error in user YAML: (<unknown>): did not find expected alphabetic or numeric character while scanning an alias at line 7 column 1
```

is caused by the line:

```markdown
---
```

at the top **and bottom** of the README file. In **YAML or some parsers**, triple dashes (`---`) are interpreted as the beginning or end of a YAML document or block, and can cause confusion in contexts like front matter or structured parsers.

### ‚úÖ **Fix**

Simply **remove the `---` lines** from the beginning and end of the file.

Here is the corrected `README.md` content:
